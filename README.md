by Jonatan Atles (elt13jat) and Mustafa Al-Kefagy (elt13mal)

Help Ogrix eat his favorite food, gold, while he slides across the lava.  
Every time Ogrix eats a golden sphere he grows in size and you as a player gain a score.  
If Ogrix hits himself or the walls he dies and you lose.  

Features:
* Bump & texture mapping.  
* Hellish skybox.  
* Phong shading.  
* Lava with waves and a moving normal map for added realism.  
* Different camera modes: You can either play with the classic snake view from above or with an immersive 3rd person view.  
* Ogrix is always moving forward and you can only change his direction.  
* There is a high score which adds to the replay value of the game.
